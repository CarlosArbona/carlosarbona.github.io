A simple hack I’ve done for years to make cold calls.

I’m constantly asked how I can bang out 100+ dials a day.

It’s incredibly simple: **I distract myself**. I’ll watch something while I’m cold calling—like a livestream or a mindless show.

With an industry 5% pickup rate, most people won’t answer. You should already have your list and talk tracks. When someone answers, flip the focus on immediately.

This is easier once you’ve been prospecting a few months and know your product, ICP, and objections.

This is how you can get into **150–200 calls/day** when prospecting is your main task. It makes cold calling easier.

i’m wary, but here we go.

i’m usually not one to post stuff like this—i kinda don’t care—but everyone else is doing it, so why not.

• **2023**: absolute killer year in sales. felt on top of the world.  
• **2024**: meh, not so hot (for everyone in sales).  
• **2025**: now i’m unemployed—again. 6th time in my 20s.

in the background, i’ve been teaching myself to code ~3.5 years—mostly ruby, some rails. biggest leap at ryan kulp’s camp (5–12 hrs/day). squeezed months into two weeks.

sales jobs can be soul-sucking, and learning to code under quota pressure is tough. friends in eng learn faster on the job. jealous? yeah. kept plugging anyway.

my last role “moved upmarket,” my manager was probably done with me. no hard feelings. sales is an incredible skill—the **God Skill**—but I want to dive into rails & building apps now.

## being realistic about work
i’ll probably need a job eventually. i want a few months of minimal distraction: code rails, read, fundamentals, get the six pack back. keep costs low and try to ship something with recurring revenue. if not, fine.

## goals for 2025

1) **deepen ruby on rails expertise**  
- recreate bootcamp vibe—5–10+ hrs/day.  
- outcome: comfortably intermediate, build & maintain apps end-to-end.

2) **build & launch saas products**  
- ship small MVPs, iterate fast.  
- “default alive”: each project covers itself (and me).

3) **leverage sales experience**  
- use pitch/close to get early adopters.  
- network + partnerships.

4) **maintain personal momentum**  
- routine & consistency (daily/weekly plan).  
- community & accountability (post updates, pair program, friends keep me honest).

5) **long-term vision**  
- financial independence via at least one SaaS covering basics.  
- evolve skills continuously.

## why this matters
1) **sustainable freedom** — tight budget + apps that pay for themselves.  
2) **professional growth** — sales + coding is a cheat code.  
3) **personal fulfillment** — I like making things; forcing it often feels good later.

so here I go—2025: all-in on rails, build real products, and see how far the sales/dev combo goes. let’s do this.

my new course on outbound cold calling is out. a founder once told me, “you can always outsource engineering, but you can’t outsource revenue.” he was right.

selling has let me date women out of my league, land jobs I shouldn’t, make more money than I knew what to do with & keep growing. and it starts with learning to **cold call**.

closing is a harder job in the abstract, but day-to-day, cold calling is the thing everyone avoids. outbound is an **algorithm**—volume in, results out.

I condensed my experience across **150,000+** cold calls into a short (< 2 hours) course. the goal: remove guesswork so you’re always ready to respond, like an algorithm.

why learn to cold call? it’s the **fastest** way to revenue from cold channels & the **cheapest**. you need a phone, scrappiness, and hustle.

maybe you’re a founder with a product but no revenue. an SDR/AE who needs to pick up the phone. or validating a new service. cold calling gets you data fast.

my first month selling web design, I made **$7,000** without knowing how to make a website. I *did* know how to cold call.

cold calling is the **god skill**. the one skill that creates magic out of thin air.

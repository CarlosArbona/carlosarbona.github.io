I've made over **250k** cold calls in my career. One thing that always comes up is voicemails. Are they worth leaving? Do they work? What kind works best?

When I was an SDR, **20–30%** of my quota came from callbacks. With a 4–6% pickup rate, that’s massive.

The best voicemail to leave cold prospects is:

> “Hey Mr. Prospect, it’s Carlos. Call me back.”

Most people don’t believe me and don’t try it. Everyone who **does** it consistently starts getting callbacks—and they’re shocked how many.

**Why it works:** unless you have an unusual name, most prospects know someone with your name. Curiosity + ambiguity triggers a callback. Sometimes they even start talking as if you’re that other person. When they realize you’re not, ask permission to continue:

> “Totally get it—this is actually Carlos from XYZ and I was originally cold calling you. Mind if I take 20–30 seconds to share why I called?”

Next time you hit voicemail, say: **“hey, it’s (your name), call me back.”** Then run your algorithm when they do.

**Carlos**

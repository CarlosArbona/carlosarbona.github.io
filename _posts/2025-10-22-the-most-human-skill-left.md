on selling in the age of ai

for years, silicon valley looked down on salespeople.  
we were the talkers. the ones who “didn’t build anything.”

meanwhile, engineers were gods. they built the tools and ran the world.

then something changed.  
the machines started building themselves.

in the age of ai, technical skill — the very thing that once made engineers untouchable — has become a commodity.  
anyone can spin up an app, write an api, or generate code with a prompt.

what can’t be automated?  
trust. judgment. human connection.  
sales.

for a long time, i thought i’d chosen the wrong path.  
i learned to code at night, believing that sales was somehow lesser.

but now, the same people who once looked down on sales are asking for help.  
they don’t have a technical problem. they have a go-to-market problem.  
they can build anything, but they can’t sell it.

growth at all cost blinded us from the only metric that ever mattered: revenue.

selling isn’t magic. it’s iteration.  
a process that compounds with every rep, every call, every failure.

you can study it the same way you study python or sql.  
you can debug it, optimize it, deploy it.

most people don’t, because sales feels personal. emotional.  
it’s the last domain where judgment still matters.

that’s exactly where i decided to build.

[discogenie](https://www.discogenie.co) is for the builder who found themselves selling.  
the technical founder who has to pitch.  
the agency owner who accidentally became a salesperson.  
the operator who realizes that every conversation is a sale.

upload your calls. it analyzes them, finds the gaps, and helps you iterate.  
it’s not a script generator; it’s a mirror.

selling isn’t just about what you say.  
it’s about understanding why people change — or why they don’t.  
fear, inertia, ego. the human side of every deal.

discogenie helps you see those patterns so you can break through them.

ai will replace the builders who stop learning.  
but it will never replace the ones who know how to connect, persuade, and close.

you can’t automate persuasion.  
you can’t api your way into trust.  
and you can’t replace a great discovery call with a chatbot.

discogenie helps founders and operators sell with the precision of top reps  
by treating sales like a craft that can be mastered.

because the best builders don’t just create products; they create demand.  
the skill that compounds fastest is the one most people avoid: selling.

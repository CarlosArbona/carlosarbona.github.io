I had just gotten fired from my sales job. I was going through a lot of family struggles at the time and my head wasn’t in the game. I’m stuck living at home with them, broke. COVID has destroyed the economy & no one wanted to interview me.

“I have to make money somehow,” I thought. But all I knew was how to prospect & sell. I didn’t really have anything to sell. Until I got a call from a friend. He needed help with his website. The only skill I had was dealing with rejection. I had no idea how to do what he wanted but I still said “sure”.

After I finished helping with the site, it hit me: “If he needs a website, maybe other people need a website too.” I looked up how to sell websites. “This could be how I make money right now.”

I cold called all the businesses in my city. Even if they didn’t have a bad website, they were game.

Most turned me down. One didn’t. I sold a site for $200. Nothing to write home about, but it was something. I finished it. Then I called more businesses. A couple said yes.

At the end of the month I had closed **$7,000** in website deals. I didn’t even know how to build websites. I went to YouTube. I called friends to help. They refused money and helped for free.

Learning how to prospect is learning how to be **superhuman**. It’s free to learn, usable every day & costs almost nothing. It might be the greatest ROI skill of all time—the **God skill**.

whenever i learn something new, i often feel a bit “dumb.” it’s because I was comparing my “doing muscle” to my “learning muscle.”

learning stretches your mind, and that stretching drains energy. I’ve made hundreds of thousands of cold calls—500 calls might be tiring but manageable. but I can only spend 3–5 hours learning Rails before I’m mentally cooked.

once the learning muscle is built, **muscle memory** kicks in. energy required for output drops.

i just tell myself **it’s not forever**.

a lot of enterprise orgs paint the picture that being an SDR is great (and it is).

but you must be careful about **where** you work as an SDR—especially in enterprise.

avoid orgs with large SDR programs and **no movement** to AE. they’ll say “it takes about a year” with no plan. carrot on a stick.

don’t be the guinea pig at orgs with no developed sales team.

typically, SDR → **SMB AE**. it’s rare to jump from enterprise SDR to enterprise AE.

if the org doesn’t sell to SMB, moving to AE will be tough.

if that’s the case, you might have to hop to a startup (risky). and if the org fails, recruiters act like *you* failed. (I’ve been let go 5×; people still saw it as my performance.)

choose orgs carefully—or risk restarting again and again.

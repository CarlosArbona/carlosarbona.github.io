the phone is the resistance.

the phone is what you’ve been ignoring but you know you must do.

it’s doing the hard thing.

doing what you know will work.

the phone is hitting the weights and losing the weight(s).

the phone is using myfitnesspal and dreadfully counting your calories.

the phone is not going out with your buddies, but building that saas app or service biz.

the phone is building out that feature you should’ve had a long time ago.

the phone is emailing your customers & asking what could be better.

the phone is asking that girl out.

on the other side of the phone is everything you want.

all you have to do is pick it up & start dialing.

I’m realizing that if something causes an emotional reaction, you should wait a day at least.

Really a week. A day doesn’t give you enough time to make an educated decision however it allows you time to make a more educated decision rather than if you made it on the spot.

This got me thinking about waiting & emotional reactions & chemicals.

When we’re being jerked around emotionally, we tend to become irrational (to an extreme). This happens to me a lot.

I’d say when I’m 100%, I’m really 110%. However when I’m out of my center, I tend to overthink everything & I cannot stop thinking about the subject.

So something I do is give myself permission to wait.

Waiting allows you space to feel your feelings, and be alright with it.

Generally speaking I hate feeling feelings. I’d rather get rid of them.

But I’m learning it is more of an art than a science. I am learning to dance with the feelings instead of ignoring them (something I would do before, which was very unhealthy).

Give yourself permission to wait.

Wait a day. Then a week. Then realize it was pretty much all in your head.

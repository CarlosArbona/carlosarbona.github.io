my perspective:
i have a lot of friends in the tech space obviously. a lot are the digital nomad type. a ton that travel by themselves are miserable. i believe there is a time & place for going solo & also with people, but generally speaking you should probably bring someone along in the long run.

we also live in the middle of a pandemic (right?). one thing i’ve seen a few times now is that we are now acting like my nomad friends act. kinda miserable.

how vital is community? how important is a social circle? i think we realize it’s essence once we have it taken away from us. the social circle is really the conception of “happiness” if we can use that word. when people think of being happy, it’s generally not in the singular sense. there is always some plurarlity to it.

when we really boil it down, what you want to be is generally happy with the right social circle around you. remove the circle and you have a temporary form of happiness. even the most introverted people i know, like to hang loose every once in a while.

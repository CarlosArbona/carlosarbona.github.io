the way to win in this world of digital commandeering is by deducing.

it is not enough to want things to happen into existence. you must actively get rid of the things you don’t want to achieve the outputs you do want.

it is a matter of reducing inputs (drinking with friends, drugs, eating bad food, hanging out with people you don’t want to because you feel obligated to), and replacing it with productive outputs that move the needle (learning to code, learning to sell, working out, getting good sleep, consistency).

it is only by getting rid of things that you can produce things. it is only by sacrificing the short term, that you can gain the long term.
